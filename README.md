# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

> The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database. In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database

## Features

* Requires users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database
* Uses the bcryptjs npm package to hash the user's password
* Implemented validations within your route handlers with express-validator
* JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for your application in a modular fashion
* React Router to set up routes
* Axios to fetch data from REST API
* Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* React
* JSX
* SQL
* ORM Sequelize
* Node.js
* Express
* npm

## Getting Started

Open a terminal or command window and browse to directory named api in the root of the repo.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).


Open another terminal or command window and browse to directory named client in the root of the repo.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Start the application.

```
npm start
```
If the development server started but it didn't open in the browser, try manually browsing to it at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
